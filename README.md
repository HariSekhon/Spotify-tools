### Inventory

- ```bash-tools/spotify_*.sh``` - [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) API scripts
  - list all public playlists for any given user, even followed playlists
  - list all private playlists for the currently authorized user
  - backup all playlists or a selection of playlists by partial name or ID
  - download playlist contents as Spotify URIs / `Artists - Track` / CSV format
  - convert Spotify track URIs to human readable `Artist - Track` / CSV format
  - iterate any command against all playlists - command can be templated with `{playlist}` name or `{playlist_id}` which will be auto-populated on each iteration
  - convert a playlist name to an ID, or an ID to a playlist name
  - search for tracks / artists / albums and output in either human readable form or as Spotify URIs for fast loading into the Spotify app or automated chaining with other adjacent tools
  - list liked / top tracks / artists in either human readable form or as Spotify URIs
  - generate a Spotify API token (used by all other bash scripts)
  - query any Spotify API endpoint with authentication (used by all other bash scripts)
- ```spotify-cmd.pl``` - Spotify desktop app control from the command line on Mac via AppleScript calls. Useful for automation that Mac HotKeys don't help with such as auto-nexting tracks every N seconds if you want to skip through sampling a playlist

### Quick Start ###

If you want to recover an entire deleted playlist, you can do that quickly in the Spotify web interface -> Account -> [Recover Playlists](https://www.spotify.com/uk/account/recover-playlists/) page.

For deleted songs in the desktop app, you can immediately press Control + Shift + Z on Windows or Control + Z on Mac to undo it.

This repo is for everything else - Backups, Conversions from HTTP URIs to readable `Artist - Track` format, tracking individual songs removed from playlists over time (if Spotify loses the rights to them they silently disappear and you won't notice if not Git revision controlling them like my repo [Spotify Playlists](https://github.com/harisekhon/spotify-playists) etc.

#### Ready to run Docker image #####

These programs and their pre-compiled dependencies can be found ready to run on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon/spotify-tools/).

List all programs:
```
docker run harisekhon/spotify-tools
```
Run any given program:
```
docker run harisekhon/spotify-tools <program> <args>
```

#### Automated Build from source #####

```
git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/spotify-tools
cd spotify-tools
make
```

This builds all dependencies after which the programs can be run.

Alternatively see the [Manual Setup](https://github.com/harisekhon/spotify-tools#manual-setup) section instead.

## Examples

### Backup Spotify Playlists

Downloads the list of public playlists to `playlists.txt` (names) and `spotify/playlists.txt` (IDs + names in TSV format)

For each playlist, downloads the list of playlist tracks to a file of the same name in both human and Spotify usable formats

As it progresses, it outputs the playlist name followed by the progress of the URI download then the human readable download

`playlists/` files contain the human readable `Artist - Track` format

`playlists/spotify/` files contain the Spotify URI format (for restores or copying to new playlists)

### Convert Spotify URIs to Human readable Artist - Track

You can copy and paste the tracks from the Spotify desktop app or web player directly into text files, which puts them in Spotify URI format such as:
```
http://open.spotify.com/track/61oGXsKgJOI0e3uS2wg1BV
http://open.spotify.com/track/1j6API7GnhE8MRRedK4bda
http://open.spotify.com/track/0RxFoUhB3mAI3qpgLSf7eM
```
or
```
spotify:track:61oGXsKgJOI0e3uS2wg1BV
spotify:track:1j6API7GnhE8MRRedK4bda
spotify:track:0RxFoUhB3mAI3qpgLSf7eM
```

Then convert this to readable `Artist - Track` form for saving independently of Spotify but running `spotify_uri_to_name.sh` against the file:

```
./bash-tools/spotify_uri_to_name.sh Pendulum.txt
Pendulum - Watercolour
Pendulum - Witchcraft
Pendulum - The Island - Pt. I
...
```

You can also pipe one or more Spotify URIs through standard input in either format that Spotify uses:

```
echo http://open.spotify.com/track/5TOYgNohZAFEPOtnchPhZS | ./bash-tools/spotify_uri_to_name.sh
Foo Fighters - Arlandria

echo spotify:track:5TOYgNohZAFEPOtnchPhZS | ./bash-tools/spotify_uri_to_name.sh
Foo Fighters - Arlandria
```

### Set all the tracks from your favourite playlist to "Liked"

Give the playlist file full of Spotify URIs (dumped by the spotify_backup*.sh scripts above), you can mark all the songs from your favourite playlists as `Liked Songs` which then appear in your `Liked Songs` playlist too:
```
spotify_set_tracks_uri_to_liked.sh playlists/spotify/My_Favourite_Playlist
```

If you've been using Spotify a long time, you'll remember that marked songs used to be called `Starred`, but were replaced by `Liked Songs`. Unfortunately Spotify made `Starred` a regular playlist and didn't carry them over, but you can easily mark all previously `Starred` songs as the newer `Liked Songs`:

```
spotify_set_tracks_uri_to_liked.sh playlists/spotify/Starred
```

### Spotify Cmd --help ###

```
./spotify-cmd.pl --help

Command line interface to Spotify on Mac that leverages AppleScript

Useful for automation that Mac HotKeys don't help with, such as auto skipping
to next track every N secs to sample a playlist while working

usage: spotify-cmd.pl <command>

commands:

play            Play
pause / stop    Pause
playpause       Toggle Play/Pause
previous        Previous Track and print previous track information
next [secs]     Next Track and print next track information.
                Specifying optional secs will skip to next track
                every [secs] seconds. Handy for skipping through a playlist
                every 60 secs automatically and grabbing the good songs. Prints
                track information every time it skips to the next track

status          Show current track details

vol up          Turn volume up
vol down        Turn volume down
vol <1-100>     Set volume to number <1-100>

exit / quit     Exit Spotify

-q  --quiet      Quiet mode. Do not print track information or volume after
                 completing action
-t  --timeout    Timeout in secs (default: 10)
-v  --verbose    Verbose mode (-v, -vv, -vvv ...)
-h  --help       Print description and usage options
-V  --version    Print version and exit
```

#### Manual Setup ####

Enter the directory and run git submodule init and git submodule update to fetch my library repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/harisekhon/spotify-tools
cd spotify-tools
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then you will also need to fetch the following CPAN modules listed in `setup/cpan-requirements.txt` and `lib/setup/cpan-requirements.txt`:

Running the cpan command followed by the list of modules (as root) will fetch them for you, or you can use this script:

```
bash-tools/perl_cpanm_install.sh setup/cpan-requirements.txt lib/setup/cpan-requirements.txt
```

### Contributions ###

Patches, improvements and even general feedback are welcome in the form of GitHub pull requests and issue tickets.

### Updating ###

Run ```make update```. This will git pull and then git submodule update which is necessary to pick up corresponding library updates.
ndencies.

If you update often and want to just quickly git pull + submodule update but skip rebuilding all those dependencies each time then run ```make update-no-recompile``` (will miss new library dependencies - do full ```make update``` if you encounter issues).
