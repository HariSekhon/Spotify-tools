$DESCRIPTION = "Command line interface to Spotify on Mac that leverages AppleScript

Useful for automation that Mac HotKeys don't help with, such as auto skipping
to next track every N secs to sample a playlist while working

Update: there is now a newer better CLI tool I found which uses the Spotify API
but requires a developer key. It should work on different operating systems other than just Mac.

https://github.com/jingweno/spotctl

This one is simpler and doesn't require API keys and also has the auto-skipping feature I used

commands:

play            Play
pause / stop    Pause
playpause       Toggle Play/Pause
previous        Previous Track and print previous track information
next [secs]     Next Track and print next track information.
                Specifying optional secs will skip to next track
                every [secs] seconds. Handy for skipping through a playlist
                every 60 secs automatically and grabbing the good songs. Prints
                track information every time it skips to the next track

status          Show current track details

vol up          Turn volume up
vol down        Turn volume down
vol <1-100>     Set volume to number <1-100>
